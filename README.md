# ADZZ Test Task

## Task
According to the official React Admin documentation from the Tutorial section, create a test application. You don't need to come up with anything new. It is important to consistently repeat the steps of the documentation and deal with the problems that will arise along the way.

### Stack
- JavaScript: https://www.w3schools.com/js/
- TypeScript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
- React: https://react.dev/
- React Admin: https://marmelab.com/
- Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/
- Vite: https://vitejs.dev/

### Result
After running the test task, we want to see a working application, an example of which can be seen at the end of the React Admin tutorial. This application must be hosted on GitHub. The repository should have a README file with instructions for running the application.

## To run the application

1. Clone this repo

2. Go to folder `adzz-test-task`:
```sh
cd adzz-test-task 
```

3. Install the application dependencies by running:

```sh
yarn
```

4. Start the application in development mode by running:

```sh
yarn dev
```

5. Chose either Local or Network option

6. You should be up and running with the React admin application on port 5173.
